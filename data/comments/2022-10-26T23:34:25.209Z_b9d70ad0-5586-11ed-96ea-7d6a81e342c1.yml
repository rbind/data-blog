  HI, I came across this very informative thread today . The writer and the
  comments massively helped me to understand the subject of 'Bioinformatics'. I
  am currently evaluating courses for my Daughter who is appearing for HSC this
  year. Wondering if someone can provide similar information about
  'BioTechnology' and 'Biomedical engg' please i.e. what is BioTech and
  Biomedical engg, what is the focus of these courses, which are the key
  subjects and finally job opportunities for them. Thanks in advance. Sandeep

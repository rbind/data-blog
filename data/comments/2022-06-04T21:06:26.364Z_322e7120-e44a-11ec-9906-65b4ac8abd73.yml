message: "Hi. I was reading this article about money raised and spent by charities - I was intrigued to see the mean average being much higher than the median and your article explains it - although we don't have all the data, there must be some high value outliers, probably by larger charities, of which there are fewer, so the median is a fairer illustration overall.\r\nhttps://www.bailiwickexpress.com/jsy/news/we-need-measure-contribution-charities-make-our-economy/#.YpvIYFMo-dO"

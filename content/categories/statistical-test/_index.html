<p>Using statistical tests, it is possible to make a statement about the significance of a set of measurements by calculating a test statistic. If it is unlikely to obtain a test statistic at least as extreme as the observed value, then the result is significant. For example, at a significance level of 5%, the probability of a false positive test result would be bounded by roughly 5%.</p>

<h2>Parametric vs non-parametric tests</h2>
<p>There is a multitude of tests for determining statistical significance. These tests can be differentiated into two categories: parametric and non-parametric tests. While parametric tests make assumptions on the distribution of the data, non-parametric tests do not rely on such assumptions. For example, the parametric t-test compares the means of two groups because it assumes that the data have a normal distribution.</p>
<p>The non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test (Mann-Whitney U test), on the other hand, considers the medians of the groups instead. If the assumptions of parametric tests are met, they are generally more capable of detecting an effect than non-parametric tests. If this is not the case, however, non-parametric tests should be preferred.</p>

<h2>Choosing an appropriate significance test</h2>
<p>To find an appropriate statistical test, the structure of the data should be considered. Before starting an analysis, one should ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many dependent/independent variables are there?</li>
<li>What are the types of the variables?</li>
<li>Are the measurements in some way associated (i.e. <a href="/tags/matched-data/">matched</a>)?</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is there besides significance?</h2>
<p>Once you have found an appropriate test, you may want to look into topics that go beyond mere significance, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I use effect sizes to describe the extent of an effect?</li>
<li>How can I use power analysis to identify the likelihood that a test detects an effect if it exists?</li>
<li>How can I interpret measurements using other quantities such as confidence intervals?</li>
</ul>

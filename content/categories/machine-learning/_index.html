<p>Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that is concerned with learning from data. Machine learning has three components:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/tags/supervised-learning/">Supervised learning</a>: Fitting predictive models using data for which outcomes are available.</li>
<li><a href="/tags/unsupervised-learning/">Unsupervised learning</a>: Transforming and partitioning data where outcomes are not available.</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning: on-line learning in environments where not all events are observable. Reinforcement learning is frequently applied in robotics.</li>
</ul>

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that is concerned with learning from data. Machine learning has three components:

* [Supervised learning](/tags/supervised-learning/): Fitting predictive models using data for which outcomes are available.
* [Unsupervised learning](/tags/unsupervised-learning/): Transforming and partitioning data where outcomes are not available.
* Reinforcement learning: on-line learning in environments where not all events are observable. Reinforcement learning is frequently applied in robotics.

<p>There is a large number of different types of plots for visualizing data.</p>
<div id="basic-plots" class="section level2">
<h2>Basic plots</h2>
<p>The following plots are frequently used:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/barplot/">bar plot</a> shows the extent of values according to the height of bars. If the data are normally distributed, they can be display variation by including error bars.</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/boxplot/">box plot</a> indicates variation by showing the most frequently observed measurements in terms of the first, second, and third quartile.</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/histogram/">histogram</a> consists of bars that indicate the frequency of measurements and is ideal for showing the distribution of a variable.</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/line-plot/">line plot</a> connects individual measurements using lines. It is most suited for time-series data.</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/scatterplot/">scatter plot</a> shows the value of two variables as points and is ideal for identifying correlated variables.</li>
</ul>

<div id="further-plots" class="section level2">
<h2>Further plots</h2>
<p>The following plots are less frequently used than the basic plots. Nevertheless, these plots may be very useful for specific applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/boxplot_alternatives/">beeswarm plot</a> is an alternative to the box plot that draws individual data points in a well-defined manner.</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/statistical_test/signed_wilcox_rank_test/">Q-Q plot</a> can be used to compare whether two samples have similar distributions.</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/radar-plot/">radar plot</a> shows the values of several properties in a circular layout.</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/data-visualization/boxplot_alternatives/">violin plot</a> is an alternative to the box plot that shows a density estimate.</li>
<li>The <a href="/post/machine-learning/dimensionality-reduction/">geospatial plot</a> is concerned with drawing the locations of entities on a map.</li>
</ul>
